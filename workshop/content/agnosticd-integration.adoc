When your workshop is deployed with AgnosticD it is the responsibility of the lab developer to also deploy Bookbag or OpenShift Homeroom with AgnosticD.
There are three deployment patterns:

* OpenShift cluster that is shared by multiple students

* OpenShift cluster per student

* Workshop without OpenShift Cluster and OpenShift Install Workshop

=== Shared OpenShift Cluster

Use `ocp4_workload_bookbag_setup` to build the bookbag image during cluster deployment and `ocp4_workload_bookbag_user` to deploy bookbag for each user.

=== Per-Student OpenShift Cluster

Use `bookbag` AgnosticD role, executing on the OpenShift cluster's bastion host during post-install.

=== No OpenShift Cluster

Use `bookbag` AgnosticD role is post-install to deploy bookbag to another OpenShift cluster.
Provide SSH information so your users can connect to the lab infrastructure from the Bookbag terminal.
