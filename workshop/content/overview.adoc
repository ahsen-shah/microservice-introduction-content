== What is Bookbag?

Bookbag is a deployment pattern for https://github.com/openshift-homeroom[OpenShift Homeroom] that is supported by Red Hat's GPTE team for demos and lab development.
While designed specifically for OpenShift, it can be used for labs and demos of any sort.
Only the OpenShift Homeroom deployment itself needs to be hosted on OpenShift or another container platform.
