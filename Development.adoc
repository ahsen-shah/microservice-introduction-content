= Bookbag Demo Development

Bookbag development is best suited for work on an OpenShift cluster.
Any recent version of OpenShift is suitable.
This demo was developed using a local development environment with https://developers.redhat.com/products/codeready-containers/overview[Red Hat CodeReady Containers].

== Build

Process and apply the OpenShift build template:

```
oc process -f build-template.yaml | oc apply -f -
```

Make edits as desired to local source, then build:

```
oc start-build bookbag --wait --follow --from-dir=.
```

Process and apply deploy template, setting `CONSOLE_IMAGE` to match the expected OpenShift version:

```
oc process -f deploy-template.yaml \
-p CONSOLE_IMAGE=quay.io/openshift/origin-console:$(oc version -o json | jq '.openshiftVersion' -r | sed 's/\.[0-9]*$//') \
| oc apply -f -
```

The deploy template includes a DeploymentConfig with an image change trigger so that it will automatically redeploy on build completion.
